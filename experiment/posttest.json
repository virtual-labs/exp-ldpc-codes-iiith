      "question": "Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a regular LDPC code with a $5$-by-$6$ parity-check matrix $H$ of rank $3$. Select the correct pair for the $\\textbf{ rate }$ and $\\textbf{ design rate }$ of the code.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "$\\textbf{ rate } = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\textbf{ design rate } = \\frac{1}{2}$",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": " The code rate is correct, but the design rate should be calculated by $\\frac{\\text{ number of rows of } H}{\\text{ number of columns of } H}$.",
        "b": " The design rate is correct, but the code rate is incorrect. The code rate is calculated by $\\frac{\\text{ rank of }H}{n}$",
        "c": " Both the rate and design rate are incorrect. The rate is calculate by $\\frac{\\text{ rank of } H}{n}$, and the design rate should be calculated by $\\frac{\\text{ number of rows of } H}{\\text{ number of columns of } H}$.",
        "d": " This is the correct answer. The code rate is $\\frac{\\text{ rank of }H}{n}$, and the design rate is calculate by $\\frac{\\text{ number of rows of } H}{\\text{ number of columns of } H}$."

      "explanations": {
        "a": " This parity-check matrix does not satisfy the regular LDPC structure. In a regular LDPC code, each row and each column must have the same number of 1s. This ensures uniform weight across rows and columns, which is not the case here.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": " While regular LDPC codes are easier to analyze, they may not perform as well as irregular codes in practice with large block lengths due to optimized connections.",
        "b": " Correct option. Irregular LDPC codes are known to perform better in practice, wspecially with large block lengths, as their structureallows for optimized variable and check node connections.",
        "c": " Short block lengths reduce error correction performance in both regular and irregular codes.",
