### Procedure

Design Plan for Exp-4 :
 
Subexp 1: 
(a) Show a matrix chosen at random from some collection of non-sparse, sparse and regular, sparse-but-irregular set of matrices. Ask user to select the type of this matrix. All matrices in the collection should have full rank. Rates can be 1/2,2/3, 1/3. Block lengths should vary from 6-10. 
 
(b) If the matrix is sparse (regular or irregular), it defines an LDPC code. Ask user to find out rate of the LDPC code. 
 
Subexp 2: 
Show a Tanner graph from a collection and ask user to select which of the H matrices it represents. Again the block lengths and rates should vary as the above.
