      "question": "In an LDPC code, the Tanner graph is used to represent which of the following?",

        "c": "Generator matrix",
        "d": "Transmission channel"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": " The Tanner graph does not represent the codeword structure directly. It represents the connections between variable nodes and check nodes from the parity-check matrix.",
        "b": " Correct! The Tanner graph visually represents the parity-check matrix by showing the relationships (or connection) between check nodes and variable nodes.",
        "c": " The Tanner graph does not represent the generator matrix but the parity-check matrix.",
        "d": " The Tanner graph has nothing to do with the transmission channel."

      "question": "The column weight of an LDPC code's parity-check matrix refers to:",
      "answers": {
        "a": " The number of rows in the matrix.",

        "c": " The number of variable nodes connected to each check node.",
        "d": " The number of columns in the matrix."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": " The number of rows in the matrix is not related to the column weight.",
        "b": " Correct! The column weight refers to the number of ones in each column, indicating how many check nodes a variable node is connected to.",
        "c": " This describes the row weight, not the column weight.",
        "d": " This refers to the size of the codewords of the given code, not the column weight."

      "question": "In a Tanner graph of an LDPC code, what do the variable nodes represent?",

        "c": "Rows of $H$",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": " Parity check equations are represented by check nodes, not variable nodes.",
        "b": " Correct! Variable nodes represent the codeword coordinates (or the variables being solved for) in a Tanner graph.",
        "c": " The rows of the parity-check matrix $H$ correspond to the check nodes, not variable nodes.",

      "question": "How many edges would the Tanner graph corresponding to the matrix $H = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ contain?",

        "b": "8",
        "c": "9",
        "d": "20"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": " The matrix $H$ has 9 non-zero elements, meaning 9 edges are required to represent the connections in the Tanner graph. 4 edges would not be enough.",
        "b": " Although 8 is closer to the correct count, the number of non-zero elements (representing edges) is 9, not 8.",
        "c": " The Tanner graph will have 9 edges, corresponding to the 9 non-zero elements in the parity-check matrix $H$.",
        "d": " More than 18 edges would be too many for this parity-check matrix."

        "a": "All rows have the same weight, and all columns have the same weight.",
        "b": "The parity check matrix has full rank.",
        "c": "The code has a constant block length.",
        "d": "All entries of the parity check matrix are either 0 or 1."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": " Correct! In a regular LDPC code, all rows have the same number of 1s (row weight) and all columns have the same number of 1s (column weight).",
        "b": " Full rank is not a defining property of a regular LDPC code, though it may be an additional feature.",
        "c": " While LDPC codes have fixed block lengths, this does not define regularity.",
        "d": " All entries being 0 or 1 is a characteristic of any binary matrix, not specific to regular LDPC codes."
